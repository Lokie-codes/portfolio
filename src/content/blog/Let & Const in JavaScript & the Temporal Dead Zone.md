With ES6, JavaScript introduced two new ways to declare variables—`let` and `const`—which provide **block scoping** and tighter control over initialization. Crucially, they also introduce the **Temporal Dead Zone** (TDZ), a window where a variable exists but cannot be accessed. In this deep dive, we’ll cover their behavior, contrast them with `var`, and explore common pitfalls and best practices.

### 1. Block Scoping vs. Function Scoping

#### 1.1 `var` Is Function-Scoped

Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their containing function (or the global scope if no function) and exist throughout that function, regardless of block boundaries:

```js
function legacy() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 1;
  }
  console.log(x); // 1 — x is visible outside the if-block
}
legacy();
```

#### 1.2 `let` & `const` Are Block-Scoped

By contrast, `let` and `const` only exist within the nearest enclosing `{ … }` block:

```js
function modern() {
  if (true) {
    let a = 2;
    const b = 3;
  }
  console.log(a); // ReferenceError: a is not defined
  console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined
}
modern();
```

This scoping prevents variables from leaking outside loops, conditionals, or inner blocks.

### 2. Understanding the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

#### 2.1 What Is the TDZ?

The **Temporal Dead Zone** extends from the start of a block until the execution reaches the variable’s declaration. During the TDZ, any attempt to access the variable throws a `ReferenceError`, even though the name is “known” to the engine.

```js
{
  // TDZ for `foo` begins here
  // console.log(foo); // ReferenceError

  let foo = 42;        // TDZ for `foo` ends here
  console.log(foo);    // 42
}
```

Behind the scenes, the engine knows that `foo` exists in this block, but deliberately stops you from touching it until after its declaration line.

#### 2.2 Why TDZ Matters

- **Avoids confusing hoisting bugs**: You can’t accidentally read an uninitialized variable.
    
- **Encourages clear ordering**: Declarations come before uses.
    
- **Helps linters catch errors**: Tools like ESLint flag TDZ violations early.
    

### 3. `let` vs. `const`: Initialization and Reassignment

#### 3.1 `let`

- **Declaration**: Creates a mutable binding.
    
- **Initialization**: Can be declared without an initial value (initialized to “uninitialized” until executed).
    
- **Reassignment**: Allowed as many times as needed.
    

```js
let counter;
counter = 0;
counter += 1;  // OK
counter = 'oops'; // Also allowed (dynamic typing)
```

#### 3.2 `const`

- **Declaration**: Creates an immutable binding.
    
- **Initialization**: Must include an initializer; you cannot write `const x;`.
    
- **Reassignment**: Disallowed—attempting to assign to a `const` after its initial definition throws a `TypeError`.
    

```js
const MAX = 100;
// MAX = 200;      // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

> **Note:** `const` applies to the _binding_, not the _value_. For objects and arrays, you can still mutate their contents:

```js
const arr = [1,2,3];
arr.push(4);     // OK — modifies the array
arr = [];        // TypeError — cannot rebind the name `arr`
```

### 4. Detailed Examples & Edge Cases

#### 4.1 Loop Variables and Closures

A common pitfall with `var` in loops was unexpected shared binding:

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 0); // Prints 3,3,3
}
```

Switching to `let` gives each iteration its own binding:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 0); // Prints 0,1,2
}
```

#### 4.2 TDZ in Function Parameters

Default parameters are initialized before the TDZ of inner `let`/`const`:

```js
function f(a = b, b = 2) {
  // The default for `a` tries to read `b` before `b` is initialized → ReferenceError
}
f();
```

To avoid this, order defaults appropriately:

```js
function g(b = 2, a = b) {
  console.log(a); // 2
}
g();
```

#### 4.3 Destructuring with `const` & `let`

Declaring via destructuring still enforces TDZ and initialization rules:

```js
// TDZ for x, y
// const { x, y } = obj; // safe only after TDZ ends

let [m, n] = [1, 2];
const {p, q} = {p:3, q:4};
```

### 5. Common Errors and Their Messages

- **TDZ Violation**:
    
    ```
    ReferenceError: Cannot access 'foo' before initialization
    ```
    
- **Reassignment of `const`**:
    
    ```
    TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
    ```
    
- **Missing Initializer for `const`**:
    
    ```
    SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
    ```
    

### 6. Best Practices

1. **Prefer `const` by Default**  
    Use `const` for any binding you don’t intend to reassign. It documents your intent and prevents accidental rebinding.
    
2. **Use `let` for Reassignable Variables**  
    When you know a variable’s value will change (counters, accumulators), use `let`.
    
3. **Declare at the Narrowest Scope**  
    Keep your `let`/`const` inside the smallest block where they’re needed to reduce cognitive load.
    
4. **Always Declare Before Use**  
    Order your code so that declarations precede all uses, avoiding TDZ issues entirely.
    
5. **Enable Strict Mode**  
    Although TDZ applies in both strict and non-strict code, strict mode offers additional safety (e.g., catching accidental globals).
    
6. **Lint for TDZ and Shadowing**  
    Use ESLint rules like [`no-use-before-define`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-use-before-define) and [`no-shadow`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-shadow) to catch subtle errors early.
