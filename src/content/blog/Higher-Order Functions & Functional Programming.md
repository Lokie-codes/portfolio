Higher-order functions (HOFs) are the cornerstone of functional programming in JavaScript. A higher-order function either **takes one or more functions as arguments**, **returns a function**, or both. Combined with principles like **immutability** and **pure functions**, HOFs enable concise, declarative code that’s easier to test and reason about. Let’s explore what makes a function “higher-order,” see common FP patterns, dive into practical examples, and review pitfalls and best practices.

### 1. What Makes a Function “Higher-Order”?

A function is higher-order if it meets at least one of these criteria:

- **Accepts one or more functions as parameters**
    
    ```js
    function repeat(n, fn) {
      for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) fn(i);
    }
    ```
    
- **Returns a function as its result**
    
    ```js
    function multiplier(factor) {
      return number => number * factor;
    }
    ```
    

By treating functions as first-class values, HOFs let you abstract control flow, resource management, and behavior into reusable building blocks.

### 2. Pure Functions & Immutability

Functional programming emphasizes **pure functions**—those that:

1. **Always return the same output** for the same inputs.
    
2. **Have no side effects** (don’t modify external state or their arguments).
    

```js
// Impure
let counter = 0;
function impureIncrement() {
  counter += 1;                // side effect
  return counter;
}

// Pure
function pureIncrement(n) {
  return n + 1;                // no side effects
}
```

Pair pure functions with **immutable data** (never mutate arrays or objects in place), and your code becomes predictable and easier to test.

### 3. Built-In HOFs: map, filter & reduce

JavaScript’s Array prototype provides three key HOFs for data transformation:

#### 3.1 `map(fn)`

Transforms every element in an array by applying `fn`:

```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = nums.map(n => n * 2);  // [2, 4, 6]
```

- Returns a **new** array, leaving the original intact.
    

#### 3.2 `filter(fn)`

Selects elements for which `fn` returns truthy:

```js
const mixed = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const evens = mixed.filter(n => n % 2 === 0);  // [2, 4]
```

- Also returns a **new** array.
    

#### 3.3 `reduce(fn, initial)`

Aggregates array elements to a single value:

```js
const values = [5, 10, 15];
const sum = values.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);  // 30
```

- `fn` receives `(accumulator, currentValue, index, array)`.
    

Chaining these methods yields powerful pipelines:

```js
const result = [1,2,3,4,5]
  .filter(n => n % 2)
  .map(n => n * n)
  .reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0);  // 1² + 3² + 5² = 35
```

### 4. Function Composition & Pipelines

When you have several unary (single-arg) functions, you can **compose** them into a pipeline:

```js
const compose = (f, g) => x => f(g(x));
const double = n => n * 2;
const increment = n => n + 1;

const incThenDouble = compose(double, increment);
console.log(incThenDouble(3));  // (3 + 1) * 2 = 8
```

For multiple functions:

```js
const pipe = (...fns) => x => fns.reduce((v, fn) => fn(v), x);

const pipeline = pipe(
  n => n + 1,
  n => n * 3,
  n => `Result: ${n}`
);
console.log(pipeline(2));  // "Result: 9"
```

Pipelines make data transformation expressively linear and declarative.

### 5. Currying & Partial Application

Currying converts a function of multiple arguments into a sequence of unary functions:

```js
function curry(fn) {
  return function curried(...args) {
    return args.length >= fn.length
      ? fn(...args)
      : (...more) => curried(...args, ...more);
  };
}
function add(a, b, c) { return a + b + c; }
const curriedAdd = curry(add);
console.log(curriedAdd(1)(2)(3));  // 6
```

**Partial application** fixes some arguments up front:

```js
const addFive = curriedAdd(5);
console.log(addFive(2,3));  // 10
```

### 6. Common Pitfalls

- **Implicit Returns vs. Braces**: Arrow functions with braces require an explicit `return`. Otherwise, you get `undefined`.
    
- **Mutating Data**: Using destructive array methods (`push`, `splice`) or object mutations breaks immutability.
    
- **Over-Chaining**: Very long chains of HOFs can be hard to debug—consider intermediate variables or named helper functions.
    
- **Poorly Named Callbacks**: Anonymous arrow callbacks can obscure intent in complex pipelines—use named functions for clarity.
    

### 7. Best Practices

1. **Favor Pure Functions**: Keep side effects at the edges of your application (I/O, UI).
    
2. **Use Immutability**: Leverage spread syntax, `Array.prototype.concat`, and libraries like Immer for safe deep updates.
    
3. **Name Your Callbacks**: When a callback does more than a trivial one-liner, assign it to a well-named `const`.
    
4. **Document Pipelines**: Add comments or break long chains into named stages.
    
5. **Leverage TypeScript or JSDoc**: Annotate function signatures for better tooling support and fewer runtime errors.
    
6. **Balance Declarative & Imperative**: Not every task suits HOFs—sometimes a simple `for` loop is clearer and just as performant.
