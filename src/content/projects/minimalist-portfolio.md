# Ultra-Minimal Portfolio

A single-page, distraction-free portfolio that surfaces only the essentials—your name, roles, key links, and latest posts—without any extra fluff.

## Features

- **Single-Scroll Layout**  
  All sections live on one page: intro, about, projects, and contact. No nested navigation.

- **MDX-Powered Content**  
  Write everything in simple `.mdx` files—no React boilerplate required.

- **Theme Toggle**  
  Instant light/dark switch that persists across sessions.

- **Zero Dependencies Beyond Core**  
  Only Next.js, Nextra, and Tailwind CSS—no UI libraries, no heavy scripts.

- **Instant Performance**  
  Static-generated pages with minimal JavaScript payload for sub-100 ms Time-to-Interactive.

## Technical Highlights

- **Next.js Static Generation**  
  Pages pre-rendered at build time for blazingly fast first loads.

- **Nextra Theme**  
  Lightweight MDX theme with minimal configuration—just drop in your content.

- **Tailwind Utility-First Styling**  
  Craft your look with atomic classes; purge unused CSS automatically.

- **Optimized Assets & Fonts**  
  Only system fonts & critical CSS shipped—no webfont blocking or large bundles.

- **Vercel-Ready**  
  One-click deploy on Vercel with zero config; previews on every push.
